# Introduction

As we know, data science is an interdisplinary field. My personal definition of data science is the problem-solving process of using data munging, data analytics and data visualization to generate actionable insights for business. There is just so much to learn. This is by no means a comprehensive and most relevant list for learning Data Science. So open for suggestions!
