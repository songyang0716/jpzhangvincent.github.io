Summary: TravisTorrent is a freely available data set synthesized from Travis CI and GitHub, which also serves as a current data challenge from The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories(MSR). 

<!--more-->
 You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.'}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
