### Who am I? 
I'm a Masters graduate student studying Computer Science and Statistics at UC Davis. I'm very enthusiatic about data science. I have been inspired by the active community of data science and benefited a lot from reading others' blogs and tutorials, for example, a list on this [page](https://github.com/rushter/data-science-blogs). So I decided to create my data science portfolio to keep track on my learning process to being a well-rounded data scientist. At the same time, it's a great opportunity to share my knowledge and give back to the community. Also, I'm also looking for data scientist jobs and I'd love to hear from you if any questions or feedbacks. 


### Why Data Science?
I think using algorithmic thinking and programming to do the right statistics in practice is the most cool thing!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/joke.png")
```

### What's the plan?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/RoadToDataScientist.png")
```


Really? Just keep learning and practicing.
