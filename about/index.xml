/BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only about &lt;strong&gt;5 - 10%&lt;/strong&gt; of my time was spent working with animals. The rest was spent designing experiments and working with data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a co-worker introduced me by saying “This is Amber, she does data analysis”, I realized that, indeed, I was a data analyst (who happened to work with marine data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to pursue the analytical side of my work and enter the world of data science. I’ve been taking &lt;a href=&#34;https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/ds_courses/&#34;&gt;lots of classes&lt;/a&gt;, working on &lt;a href=&#34;../portfolio/&#34;&gt;lots of personal projects&lt;/a&gt;, joining local Meetups, and looking for work in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always looking for new people to chat with and new problems to solve, so feel free to reach out to me!&lt;/p&gt;
